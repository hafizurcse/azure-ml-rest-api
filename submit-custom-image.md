# Submitting a Run with a custom docker image

This example shows you

* How to submit a run with a custom docker image

## Pre-requisites

 * [Follow the getting started example](./rest-submit-run.md) to generate relevant data and to understand basic call patterns.


## Prepare files for run

To submit a run, prepare two files: a zip folder that contains your training script, called project.zip, and definition.json file. Place these two files in the working directory of your local Python interpreter.

The project.zip should have [this code_runner.py](./code_runner.py) Python file at its root.


Use the following definition.json file to submit a program that takes in a command line and executes it inside the custom image (note the "BaseImageRegistry" section below):

```json
{
    "Configuration":{
       "Script":"code_runner.py",
       "Arguments":[
          "/code/in_custom_image/custom_binary",
          "firstArg",
          "--secondArg",
          "Value"
       ],
       "SourceDirectoryDataStore":null,
       "Framework":"Python",
       "Communicator":"None",
       "Target":"cpu-cluster",
       "MaxRunDurationSeconds":1200,
       "NodeCount":1,
       "Environment":{
          "Python":{
             "InterpreterPath":"python",
             "UserManagedDependencies":false,
             "CondaDependencies":{
                "name":"project_environment",
                "dependencies":[
                   "python=3.6.2"
                ]
             }
          },
          "Docker":{
             "BaseImage":"mycustomimage:1.0",
             "BaseImageRegistry":{
                "Address": "myregistry.azurecr.io",
                "Username": "username",
                "Password": "password"
             }
          }
      },
       "History":{
          "OutputCollection":true
       }
    }
}
```

## Submit run

Submit a run by making a multi-part POST request against execution service with the 2 files from previous step

```python
executionbase = "execution/v1.0/"
resourcebase = "subscriptions/{}/resourceGroups/{}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{}/".format(subid,rg,ws)

start_run = hosturl+ executionbase + resourcebase + "experiments/{}/startrun".format(experiment_name)

run_files = {"runDefinitionFile": ("definition.json", open("definition.json","rb")), "projectZipFile": ("project.zip", open("project.zip","rb"))}

resp = requests.post(start_run, files=run_files, headers=header)

print("response text: ", json.loads(resp.text))
```

## Tag the run

Tagging runs lets you later retrieve runs by more meaningful identifiers than the run ID.

```python
run_id = resp.json()["runId"]

run_uri = hosturl + historybase + resourcebase + "experiments/{}/runs/{}".format(experiment_name,run_id)
payload = {
   "tags": {
      "customimage": "specialrun"
   }
}

# If you forget the content type header, you'll get an HTTP 415
header.update({
    "content-type": "application/json"
})
resp = requests.patch(run_uri, json=payload, headers=header)
print(resp.json()["tags"])
```

## Retrieve a run by tag

Later, you can fetch the run by querying the experiment

```python
query_runs = hosturl + historybase + resourcebase + "experiments/{}/runs:query".format(experiment_name)
payload = {
   "filter": "Tags/customimage eq specialrun",
    "top": 1
}

resp = requests.post(query_runs, json=payload, headers=header)
print(resp.json()["value"][0])
```

## Monitor status of run

You can track the status of the run by polling the run history service.

```python
run_id = resp.json()["value"][0]["runId"]

get_run = hosturl + historybase + resourcebase + "experiments/{}/runs/{}".format(experiment_name,run_id)

status = None

while status not in ["Completed", "Failed", "Cancelled"]:
    time.sleep(5)
    resp = requests.get(get_run, headers=header)
    status = json.loads(resp.text)["status"]
    print(status)
```

## Get the full details for the run

Finally, you can fetch all of the details for a given run, including log files and the run definition. Note: do not poll on this slower endpoint.

```python
get_rundetails = hosturl + historybase + resourcebase + "experiments/{}/runs/{}/details".format(experiment_name, run_id)

resp = requests.get(get_rundetails, headers=header)
print(resp.json())
```

## Optional: Delete tags

As Tags are mutable as opposed to Properties, you might want to delete a tag on a run

```python
delete_runtags = hosturl + historybase + resourcebase + "experiments/{}/runs/{}/tags".format(experiment_name, run_id)
payload = ["customimage"]

resp = requests.delete(delete_runtags, json=payload, headers=header)
print(resp.json())
```
